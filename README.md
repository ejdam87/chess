# Chess

This is an OOP implementation of classic chess game with usage of Java standard library.

## Functionality
Besides playing against human players, there are also a couple of bot implementations (strategies). Namely, a bot making random moves, and the bot trying to estimate the best move based on min-max algorithm.

In the future, I plan to add also a bot based on alpha-beta algorithm (optimization of min-max) and maybe some reinforcement learning or other ML techniques.
